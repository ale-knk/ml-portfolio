# ðŸ§  Machine Learning Portfolio

Welcome to my professional portfolio of machine learning projects. Each project is a standalone, well-structured module focused on a specific area of ML engineering â€” from model serving to monitoring, pipelines, and explainability.

All projects are included in this repository as Git submodules.

## ðŸ“¦ Projects Overview

| Project | Description | Stack | Link |
|---------|-------------|-------|------|
| **ml-serve** | Serve ML models via REST API with integrated feedback collection and model monitoring (drift, performance, alerts). | FastAPI, MLflow, PostgreSQL, S3, Docker Compose | [ml-serve](./ml-serve) |
| **bike-rental-demand-pred** | Train Transformer-based models to predict bike rental demand in a bike-sharing system. | PyTorch| [bike-rental-demand-pred](./bike-rental-demand-pred) |
| **genetic-feature-selector** | Feature selection using genetic algorithms with multiple initialization strategies and elitism. | scikit-learn, tqdm, matplotlib | [genetic-feature-selector](./genetic-feature-selector) |
| **mlflow-dash** | Explore and analyze MLflow experiments with a simple dashboard. | Streamlit, MLflow | [mlflow-dash](./mlflow-dash) |
| **ml-lab** | Minimal MLOps environment with MLflow and Docker Compose. | MLflow, Docker, PostgreSQL | [ml-lab](./ml-lab) |
| **modelxplain** | Visualize and explain model predictions using SHAP. | Streamlit, SHAP, scikit-learn | [modelxplain](./modelxplain) |
