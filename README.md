# ðŸ§  Machine Learning Portfolio

Welcome to my professional portfolio of machine learning projects. Each project is a standalone, well-structured module focused on a specific area of ML engineering â€” from model serving to monitoring, pipelines, and explainability.

All projects are included in this repository as Git submodules.
